# 📊 Crime Data Analysis Dashboard

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard developed using a crime dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It focuses on data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization to uncover key insights about crime patterns, demographics, and locations.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI** – For data modeling, interactive dashboards, and data visualization  
- **Power Query** – For data transformation and cleaning  
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV** – Raw data handling  
- **Kaggle** – Data source

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Removed irrelevant columns that did not contribute to the analysis
- Handled null and missing values appropriately
- Standardized categorical fields like victim sex, descent, and area names
- Parsed and formatted date fields for temporal analysis

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 📍 Area-wise Crime Rate
- Identified regions with significantly higher crime occurrences
- Compared across multiple areas using bar and column charts

### 👥 Gender-based Impact
- Analyzed which gender groups were most affected
- Included breakdown by arrest status and crime category

### 👶👵 Age Group Distribution
- Segmented victims by age groups to highlight demographic exposure
- Used donut and stacked bar visuals to display patterns

### 📆 Temporal Patterns
- Visualized crimes by occurrence date to identify trends and spikes

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Incorporate **predictive analytics** using machine learning models
- Add **geo-mapping visualizations** to plot crimes on a map
- Create **dynamic filters** and slicers for enhanced interactivity
- Integrate external APIs (e.g., weather or location services) for multi-dimensional analysis
